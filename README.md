##BlackJack

This is a simple card game with a simple logic, created just for practice purpose.<br>
The logic is that the user when clicks on start game, will be assigned with two random cards and the sum of the value of cards will be calculated. Until the sum value of cards is less than 21, the user can keep requesting for new cards by clicking on new card button. Once the value is equal to 21, the user wins and is declared **BlackJack** and the game terminates.<br>
However, if the sum value of cards exceeds 21, the person loses the game, and again the game terminates.Also, there is a chip value in the bottom of the new card button option which describes the number of that the person is left with. However, the chip value is static and won't change with any number of games.
